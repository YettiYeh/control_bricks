Control Bricks

A collection of composable PCBs for building simple automation solutions.

Bricks are connected in sequence, each performing a simple function before
passing control to the next brick. 
Bricks can have inputs for sensors and outputs for actuators.

The goal is to create reliable and maintainable solutions 
without any custom application specific software. 
The PCBs provide buttons and indicators for the control interface. 
Each output has buttons for manual activation for testing and debugging.
